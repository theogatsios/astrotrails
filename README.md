Astrotrails generates startrails images by stacking multiple photographs of the night sky.
It takes a series of individual night sky photos and combines them to create a composite image (and also a timelapse video) that showcases the apparent motion of stars as the Earth rotates.

```bash
pip install astrotrails
```
